- **Group B:** Traditional study materials (equivalent time)
- Weekly check-ins and progress monitoring
- Technical support for platform users

#### **Week 4: Assessment & Feedback**
- Administer post-study assessment
- Collect platform analytics data
- Conduct user experience surveys
- Optional follow-up interviews (5-10 participants)

### 6. Data Analysis Plan

#### **Quantitative Analysis**
```r
# Statistical tests to perform
- Paired t-test: Pre/post scores within groups

2. **Pre/post assessment only** (skip control group)
3. **Focus on platform analytics** and user feedback
4. **Document methodology** and preliminary findings
5. **Frame as pilot study** for future research

### **If No Formal Study Possible:**
1. **Expert Review:** Have cybersecurity faculty evaluate platform
2. **Heuristic Evaluation:** Apply usability principles assessment
3. **Technical Validation:** Security expert code review
