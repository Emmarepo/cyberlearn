## Slide 6: Security Implementation Deep Dive
### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// Secure password validation
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);
const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(inputPassword, hashedPassword);

// JWT with role-based access
token.role = dbUser?.role || 'user';
```
