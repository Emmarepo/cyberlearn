UserProgress {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  userId: String (Foreign Key)
  moduleId: String
  completionPercentage: Float
  lastAccessed: DateTime
}

-- Assessment results
QuizResult {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  userId: String (Foreign Key)
  quizType: String
  score: Int

  completedAt: DateTime
}

-- Gamification system
Achievement {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  name: String
  description: String
  badgeIcon: String
  pointsRequired: Int
}
```

### 3.3 Security Architecture

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User credentials validated against bcrypt-hashed passwords
2. JWT token generated with user ID and role
3. Middleware validates tokens on protected routes
4. Session data includes user context for authorization

**Data Protection:**
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- XSS protection via React's built-in sanitization
- CSRF protection through NextAuth.js
