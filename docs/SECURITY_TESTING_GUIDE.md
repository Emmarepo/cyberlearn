# ðŸ”’ Security Testing & Validation Guide

## Academic Security Assessment Requirements

### 1. Security Testing Checklist

#### **Authentication & Authorization Testing**
- [ ] **Password Policy Enforcement**
  - Test minimum length requirements
  - Verify character complexity validation
  - Confirm bcrypt hashing implementation
  
- [ ] **Session Management**
  - JWT token expiration testing
  - Session hijacking prevention
  - Concurrent session handling
  
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control**
  - Admin route protection verification
  - User privilege escalation prevention
  - Unauthorized access attempt logging

#### **Input Validation & Injection Prevention**
- [ ] **SQL Injection Testing**
  - Test all form inputs with SQL payloads
  - Verify Prisma ORM parameterization
  - Database query sanitization validation
  
- [ ] **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - Test script injection in all input fields
  - Verify React's built-in sanitization
  - Content Security Policy validation
  
- [ ] **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
  - Test unauthorized state-changing requests
  - Verify NextAuth.js CSRF protection
  - Token validation on sensitive operations

#### **Data Protection & Privacy**
- [ ] **Sensitive Data Handling**
  - Password storage security (never plaintext)
  - Personal information encryption
  - Database connection security
  
- [ ] **API Security**
  - Rate limiting implementation
  - Authentication requirement on protected endpoints
  - Error message information disclosure prevention

### 2. Manual Security Testing Procedures

#### **Authentication Security Test**
```bash
# Test 1: Weak password rejection
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "email": "test@test.com",
  "password": "123",
  "name": "Test User"
}
Expected: Validation error

# Test 2: SQL injection attempt
POST /api/auth/signin
{
  "email": "admin@cybersec.com'; DROP TABLE users; --",
  "password": "anything"
}
Expected: Safe handling, no database impact
```

#### **Authorization Test**
```bash
# Test 3: Unauthorized admin access
GET /admin
Without valid admin session
Expected: Redirect to login

# Test 4: Role escalation attempt
Modify JWT token role claim
Expected: Token validation failure
```

#### **Input Validation Test**
```bash
# Test 5: XSS attempt in quiz
POST /api/quizzes/submit
{
  "answers": ["<script>alert('xss')</script>"]
}
Expected: Sanitized storage, no script execution
```

### 3. Automated Security Scanning

#### **Tools for Academic Use**
- **OWASP ZAP:** Free web application security scanner
- **npm audit:** Dependency vulnerability checking
- **ESLint Security Plugin:** Static code analysis
- **Lighthouse Security Audit:** Browser-based security assessment

#### **Implementation Commands**
```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scan
npm audit

# Security linting
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --config eslint-security-config

# OWASP ZAP baseline scan (if available)
zap-baseline.py -t http://localhost:3001
```

### 4. Security Documentation for Academic Submission

#### **Threat Model Documentation**
```markdown
## Identified Threats:
1. **Authentication Bypass:** Mitigated by NextAuth.js + bcrypt
2. **Data Injection:** Prevented by Prisma ORM + Zod validation
3. **Session Hijacking:** Protected by secure JWT configuration
4. **Privilege Escalation:** Blocked by middleware role checking
5. **Data Exposure:** Secured by environment variable protection
```

#### **Security Implementation Evidence**
- **Code References:** Specific files and line numbers
- **Configuration Details:** Security headers, HTTPS enforcement
- **Testing Results:** Evidence of vulnerability testing
- **Compliance Mapping:** OWASP Top 10 coverage analysis

### 5. Academic Security Assessment Report Template

```markdown
# Security Assessment Report
## CyberLearn Platform Security Analysis

### Executive Summary
[Brief overview of security posture]

### Methodology
- Manual testing procedures
- Automated scanning tools

- Compliance framework mapping

### Findings
#### High Priority
- [Any critical issues found]

#### Medium Priority
- [Important improvements identified]

#### Low Priority
- [Minor enhancements suggested]

### Implemented Security Controls
1. **Authentication:** NextAuth.js with bcrypt hashing
2. **Authorization:** Role-based access with JWT
3. **Input Validation:** Zod schemas with type safety
4. **Database Security:** Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
5. **Session Management:** Secure JWT configuration
6. **Infrastructure:** HTTPS, environment variable protection

### Compliance Analysis
- **OWASP Top 10:** Coverage assessment
- **NIST Framework:** Security control mapping
- **Academic Standards:** Documentation requirements met

### Recommendations
[Future security enhancements]

### Conclusion
[Overall security posture assessment]

## Quick Security Validation Commands

### **For Academic Demonstration:**
```bash
# 1. Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" --exclude-dir=node_modules .

# 2. Verify environment variable usage
grep -r "process.env" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .

# 3. Check authentication implementation
grep -r "bcrypt\|hash" --include="*.ts" .

# 4. Verify input validation
grep -r "zod\|validate" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
```

### **Security Headers Check (Browser DevTools)**
```javascript
// Check security headers in Network tab
Response Headers should include:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security (in production)
```

## Academic Security Questions - Prepared Answers

### **Q: "How do you prevent SQL injection?"**
**A:** "I use Prisma ORM which automatically parameterizes all database queries. Additionally, all user inputs are validated using Zod schemas before reaching the database layer. Here's the implementation..." [Show code]

### **Q: "What's your authentication security strategy?"**
**A:** "Three-layer approach: bcrypt password hashing with 12 salt rounds, JWT session management through NextAuth.js, and middleware-enforced route protection. All sensitive routes require valid authentication tokens."

### **Q: "How do you handle sensitive data?"**
**A:** "Passwords are never stored in plaintext - only bcrypt hashes. Environment variables protect database credentials and JWT secrets. The database schema separates sensitive user data appropriately."

### **Q: "What about XSS prevention?"**
**A:** "React provides built-in XSS protection through automatic escaping. I also implement Zod validation for all inputs and use TypeScript for additional type safety. Content Security Policy headers are configured in production."

## Security Testing Evidence for Academic Submission

### **Documentation to Include:**
1. **Security Testing Report** with methodology and results
2. **Vulnerability Assessment** showing no critical issues
3. **Code Security Review** with explanations
4. **Compliance Checklist** against academic security standards
5. **Penetration Testing Results** (if required by institution)

### **Academic Security Compliance:**
- Document all security decisions with rationale
- Provide evidence of testing and validation
- Map implementation to security frameworks
- Include future security enhancement plans
