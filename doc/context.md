# 📚 Project Context: CyberSecure Learning Platform

## 📌 Project Overview  
**CyberSecure Learning Platform** is a modern, web-based interactive education platform designed to teach students and individuals the fundamentals of cybersecurity. The platform provides hands-on lessons, quizzes, security awareness tools, and activities that help users recognize security threats and apply defensive strategies in real-life scenarios.

The application is built with **Next.js (React + TypeScript)** for the frontend and backend logic via **API routes**. It leverages **Firebase** for authentication and data management, with **Vercel** handling hosting and continuous deployment.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Educate users about essential cybersecurity principles in an engaging, interactive way.
- Provide interactive tools like password strength checkers and phishing simulations.
- Track user engagement and learning outcomes through quizzes and feedback.
- Maintain a scalable, continuously deployable platform hosted on **Vercel**.

## 🖥️ Key Features
- **Interactive Password Strength Checker**
- **Phishing Email Identification Quizzes**
- **Real-time User Authentication with Firebase**
- **User Progress Tracking**
- **Secure API endpoints using Next.js API routes**
- **Responsive and accessible interface**
- **Continuous deployment via Vercel**
- **User feedback collection via Google Forms or built-in modules**

## 🚀 Project Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cybersecure-learning-platform.git
   cd cybersecure-learning-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Connect your GitHub repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
   - Vercel automatically detects Next.js projects and deploys them with optimized defaults.
   - Every commit to the `main` branch will trigger an automatic deployment.

## 📄 Firebase Setup (Optional for Contributors)
1. Create a new Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable **Email/Password Authentication**
3. Set up a **Firestore Database**
4. Copy your Firebase project configuration details.
5. Replace the placeholder config values inside `/src/firebase.ts` (or your equivalent config file).
